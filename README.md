# QuakeInsight
Project Overview QuakeInsight is a machine learning-based platform designed to enhance earthquake monitoring and prediction. By combining AI with seismic data, it provides better real-time analysis, earthquake magnitude prediction, and clustering of seismic events.

Key Features: Earthquake Magnitude Prediction: Predict the strength of future earthquakes. Real-time Seismic Activity Analysis: Analyze seismic data as it happens. Clustering and Declustering of Events: Group and separate seismic events for better analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize earthquake data trends and patterns.

Technologies Used: Backend: Python, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Frontend: Next.js: React framework for server-side rendering, routing, and API integration. React: For building the user interface with reusable components. TypeScript: For added type safety and better code quality. Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for creating fast and responsive UI. Shadcn/UI: Radix-based UI components that integrate seamlessly with Tailwind CSS. Framer Motion: Animations and transitions to enhance user interaction. Recharts: For interactive and responsive charts to visualize data. Leaflet: For embedding interactive maps and geospatial data visualization. Lucide React: A collection of high-quality icons for UI consistency.

How to Run the Project Locally: Install Required Libraries:

For Python (Backend): pip install pandas

For Frontend (Node.js): npm install Run the Frontend Server: npm run dev
